**DURATION**: 8 WEEKS

**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH

The goal of Task 4 was to explore and design how AR (Augmented Reality) can be integrated into a mobile application to enhance user interaction and usability. I chose to create ARNav, an AR-powered navigation app concept that combines real-world camera input with live digital overlays to guide users with directions, points of interest (POIs), and interactive features.

Unlike traditional map apps that rely only on 2D views, ARNav overlays live 3D arrows, direction labels, POI markers, and booking options on top of the camera view, providing a highly immersive and futuristic experience. The app is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and effective for everyday navigation, while showcasing the full potential of augmented reality in UI/UX design.
